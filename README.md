# DomainCppShooter

My first all-C++ game for practicing foundational C++ with Unreal Engine 5.

This is a working project, but please note that some of the assets I've used may not be free to publish. While many are available on the Fab.com marketplace, I've taken measures to ensure I do not publish any assets for which I do not have full rights.


If you are trying to replicate this project, the following Fab.com content was not included in the repository. You will need to add these items (or use your own assets) to the appropriate folders for the project to function as intended:

- Fab/Megascans/3D/Marble_Pestle_ud4nfcqva/Medium
- Military
- MilitaryAirport
- MilitaryWeapDark
- ModSci_Engineer
- ModSci_EngiProps
- ModSciInteriors


The Characters skeletal Mesh's Used: 

- Player: SK_Military_Survivalist_4
- AI: SK_Military_Survivalist_1

* NOTE: both of these characters use the same skeleton: UE4_Mannequin_Skeleton include in the Military pack


The sockets on the character skeletons are as follows:

- Player: hand_r -> socket named "PlayerWeaponSocket"
- AI: hand_r -> socket named "AIWeaponSocket"
